# Tableau Project: Big Mac Index

## Description
This project analyzes the **Big Mac Index**, a tool created by *The Economist* to evaluate the relative value of currencies across countries using the price of a Big Mac as a reference.

The visualization compares the price of a Big Mac in various countries against its price in the United States. This analysis helps identify:
- The overvaluation or undervaluation of currencies relative to the US dollar.
- Price differences between countries and regions.
- Economic trends reflected in the relative cost of a universal product.
